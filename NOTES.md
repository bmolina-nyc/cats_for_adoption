I want to grab cats from the website: http://www.adoptapet.com/shelter80748-cats.html
- Grab all indexes
- Go into each index and get some info about the cat

The CLI - shows a list of cats and you choose the cat you want to know about

user types cats_for_adoption

Show a list of cats

1. Lola
2. Dextoo
3. Peppone

Which cat would you like info on?

 

google - patterns people use to create gems
gems that are libraries
gems that are cli’s 

 


# create a gem – stub out all the structure  - maybe watch the railscast
